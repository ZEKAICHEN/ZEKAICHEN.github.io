Hi, I'm Zekai Chen (陈泽锴)! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/) working with [Prof. Susan Cheng](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cheng/). My general research interests include machine intelligence and data mining. I'm especially interested in faster sequence modeling and efficient deep learning. I've done some trackable work on multi-task time series forecasting as well. One may follow my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fq_lCEEAAAAJ) if interested. Also, I'm open in the job market of 2021! Please find my [CV](pages/ZekaiChen_CV.pdf) here.
