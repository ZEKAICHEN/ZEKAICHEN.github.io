**About me**

Hi, I'm Zekai(Zach) Chen (陈泽锴)! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/) working with [Prof. Susan Cheng](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cheng/). My general research interests include Machine Intelligence and Data Mining. I mainly focus on interesting problems such as multi-task machine learning, sequence modeling, efficient deep learning, graph learning in IoT and anomaly detection. My research experience includes multi-task time series forecasting, sequence modeling acceleration in attention, graph structure learning for anomaly detection, and general data mining. For my research domains, one may follow my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fq_lCEEAAAAJ) if interested. Also, I'm open in the job market of 2021 Fall! Please find my [CV](pages/ZekaiChen_CV.pdf) here.
